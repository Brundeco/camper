* `nvm install` to switch to the project's node version (`stable` is the default version specified in `/.nvmrc`).
You may pin this to a specific major version should the need arise.
* `npm update` to install most recent versions of depencies specified in `package.json` (run this if you)
* `npm run watch` to build assets while watching the source files;
`npm run prod` to build assets suitable for use in production
